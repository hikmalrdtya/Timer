## üé® Customization

The application's theme and core visual properties can be easily customized without a `tailwind.config.js` file, thanks to CSS Variables.

To change colors, fonts, or shadows, simply edit the variables defined at the top of the `src/css/input.css` file inside the `:root` block.

```css
/* src/css/input.css */

@layer base {
  :root {
    /* Define all your custom values here */
    --font-pixel-stack: 'pixel', "Segoe Ui", sans-serif, monospace;
    
    /* Color Palette */
    --color-yellow: #FFE600;
    --color-orange-light: #FFB600;
    /* ...etc. */

    /* Other Values */
    --shadow-chunky: 4px 4px 0px #000;
  }
}
